## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sgrolab/cellsimilaritymodel.git
cd cellsimilaritymodel
```

### 2. Install uv
The project's dependencies are pinned in `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` and managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). If you don't already have it:

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**Alternative (using pip):**
```bash
pip install uv
```

### 3. Create the Environment and Install the Package
```bash
uv sync
```
This creates a virtual environment in `.venv` with Python 3.13 (downloading it if necessary), installs the pinned dependencies from `uv.lock`, and installs the `las_model` package itself in editable mode, so `import las_model` works inside that environment.

There is no need to activate the environment: prefix every command with `uv run`, which runs it inside `.venv` (and creates or refreshes the environment first if `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock` changed):
```bash
uv run python --version
```

If you prefer another environment manager (for example conda), install the dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`, drop the `uv run` prefix from the commands below, and point Python at the sources with `PYTHONPATH=./src`.

### 4. Point the Code at Your Data Directory
All simulation outputs and figure inputs live outside the repository, in a directory the code calls `PROJECT_DIR`. It is read from the `ROOT_DIR` environment variable by `src/las_model/utils/config.py`, which also loads a `.env` file from the repository root if one exists (`.env` is git-ignored). Either create that file once:
```bash
echo "ROOT_DIR=/path/to/your/data/directory" > .env
```
or set the variable for each command:
```bash
ROOT_DIR=/path/to/your/data/directory uv run src/las_model/figures/plot_figures.py
```

The directory must contain a `graphics/` folder with the schematic PNGs that the figures place next to the plots. Simulation outputs are written beneath it by `las_model.utils.output.save_experiment`, one folder per experiment:
```
<ROOT_DIR>/<experiment_directory>/<experiment_name>/<experiment_name>.pickle   # the data
<ROOT_DIR>/<experiment_directory>/<experiment_name>/metadata.json              # the parameters it was run with
```

### 5. Verify the Installation
```bash
uv run python -c "from las_model.utils.config import PROJECT_DIR; print(f'Project directory: {PROJECT_DIR}')"
```
This should print the data directory you configured. If it fails with a `TypeError` mentioning `NoneType`, `ROOT_DIR` is not set.

## Running the Code

### Simulations
Each experiment is one script under `src/las_model/simulations/figure_XX/`, named after the figure it feeds. Its parameters are the `metadata` dictionary at the top of the script, which is also saved alongside the results. A script can be run directly:
```bash
uv run src/las_model/simulations/figure_02/satprod_PprodAsweep.py
```
`src/las_model/simulations/run_simulations.py` runs them in bulk, each in its own process and in dependency order:
```bash
uv run src/las_model/simulations/run_simulations.py --dry-run                 # list what a full run would do
uv run src/las_model/simulations/run_simulations.py                           # run every folder
uv run src/las_model/simulations/run_simulations.py figure_02 figure_S10      # whole folders
uv run src/las_model/simulations/run_simulations.py figure_06/cascade_time.py # single scripts, by path or bare name
uv run src/las_model/simulations/run_simulations.py --root-dir /other/data --log logs
uv run src/las_model/simulations/run_simulations.py --help
```
`--root-dir` writes the data somewhere other than `ROOT_DIR`; `--log` keeps each script's output in a file. `--progress` draws one progress bar per script on the terminal, and combined with `--log` sends the scripts' own output to the log only, so the terminal shows just the bars. Failing scripts are reported at the end and the rest still run, unless `--stop-on-error` is given. The parameter sweeps show the same progress bars when run by hand; set `TQDM_DISABLE=1` to turn them off. A full run takes many hours, dominated by the spatial grid simulations and the large parameter sweeps.

Parameter sweeps run their points in parallel across all CPU cores, so the driver runs scripts one at a time. A few supplementary figures reuse another figure's simulation; their folders hold a stub or README pointing at the script to run.

### Figures
`src/las_model/figures/plot_figures.py` draws the main and supplementary figures from the data in `ROOT_DIR`, or in the directory given with `--root-dir`. Without arguments it opens each figure in a window; with `--save` it writes them to disk instead:
```bash
uv run src/las_model/figures/plot_figures.py                          # show every figure
uv run src/las_model/figures/plot_figures.py figure_02 figure_S04     # just these
uv run src/las_model/figures/plot_figures.py --save figs --format pdf --dpi 300
uv run src/las_model/figures/plot_figures.py --help
```
Each figure is a function, `figure_01` ... `figure_S21`, so in Spyder or VS Code (with the interpreter set to `.venv/bin/python`, or `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` on Windows) you can run the file to define them and then call one, e.g. `figure_02()`, from the console. A figure whose data has not been generated yet is reported as failed and the others still run.

### Roboto Font (optional)
The figure script labels its panels with the Roboto font. If Roboto is not installed, matplotlib falls back to DejaVu Sans and prints a warning for every label:
```
findfont: Font family 'roboto' not found.
```
The figures still render; only the panel letters look different. To install the font:

1. Download the Roboto family (Apache License 2.0) from Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto
2. Install the `.ttf` files:
   - **macOS:** open each file and click *Install* in Font Book, or copy them to `~/Library/Fonts/`.
   - **Linux:** copy them to `~/.local/share/fonts/` and run `fc-cache -f`.
   - **Windows:** right-click each file and choose *Install*.
3. Delete matplotlib's cached font list so it rescans the system fonts on the next run:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   rm ~/.matplotlib/fontlist-*.json
   # Linux
   rm ~/.cache/matplotlib/fontlist-*.json
   ```
4. Verify that matplotlib can see the font:
   ```bash
   uv run python -c "from matplotlib import font_manager; print(sorted({f.name for f in font_manager.fontManager.ttflist if 'Roboto' in f.name}))"
   ```
   This should print a list containing `'Roboto'`.
